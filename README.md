## Problem
Gig workers (primary focus - Uber/Uber Eats drivers) ace highly variable weekly earnings due to inconsistent hours, fluctuating demand, and external factors such as weather, events, and competition. This income volatility makes financial planning and budgeting difficult, often leading to stress and uncertainty. Existing budgeting or finance apps are not built around the realities of gig work, where income is irregular and driven by dynamic working conditions.
Solution
Steady helps Uber drivers achieve more predictable earnings by analyzing their historical work data, forecasting future income, and generating behavioral insights that explain what influences their weekly results. The app provides personalized recommendations on when and where to work, how many hours to aim for, and how to smooth income week to week. Its purpose is to turn unpredictable work into stable, informed decision-making.
Core Features
Earnings Forecasting – Predicts the upcoming week’s expected income using past earnings and trip data, with confidence intervals that reflect volatility.


# Behavioral Insights 
– Surfaces trends that affect earnings stability, such as consistent working hours, high-performing zones, and top earning days.


# Steadiness Index 
– A quantitative measure of income stability over time, showing users whether their earnings are becoming more predictable.


# Goal Tracking 
– Allows users to set a weekly income floor and track their progress toward maintaining consistent earnings.


# Context-Aware Recommendations 
– Integrates public data sources (weather, holidays, and local events) to explain income fluctuations and suggest optimal work times or conditions.


# Target Users
-Uber and Uber Eats workers (drivers, couriers, and delivery partners)
-Primarily independent workers with fluctuating hours and earnings
-Individuals who rely on platform work as a main or supplementary source of income


# Value Proposition
For drivers and couriers: reduced income anxiety, better week-to-week predictability, and clearer visibility into what factors improve or hurt their earnings.
For policymakers or researchers (future potential): anonymized insights into gig economy earnings patterns and volatility trends.


Demo Scope
The demo version of Steady focuses on Uber and Uber Eats workers. It uses simulated data modeled on real Uber trip and weekly earnings structures to show:
Weekly income forecasts and volatility visualization


Personalized behavioral insights based on trip-level patterns


How contextual data (e.g., rain, public holidays) influences weekly earnings


While the driver data is simulated due to API access limitations, all contextual data in the demo is drawn from real, publicly available sources. In production, Steady would replace simulated driver data with authenticated inputs from Uber’s Driver API 
Future Vision
Steady aims to become a financial stability companion for Uber drivers and couriers. In future versions, the app could incorporate automatic data syncing, deeper behavioral analytics, and features that support long-term financial resilience—such as goal-based saving nudges, volatility insurance, or income smoothing mechanisms for consistent take-home pay.

## Vision
# micro:
Empower individual Uber and Uber Eats drivers with financial clarity and control. By helping them anticipate their income, understand what drives volatility, and make smarter work decisions, Steady directly improves their financial well-being and sense of security.
# macro:
Advance economic stability and fairness within the gig economy. As Steady scales, aggregated and anonymized data can shed light on systemic volatility patterns — informing better public policy, fairer platform practices, and data-driven approaches to improving income predictability across the global gig workforce
